# Welcome to my website. 
Hi, my name is Chris O'Brien.  During the school year I'm a math and computer science teacher at [Lehman High School](https://lehmanhs.com/) in the Bronx.

Right now I'm taking [CS classes at Hunter College](https://info.huntercs.org/). Here's what I've been doing this summer:

## Intro to programming

## Data structures

## Methods
For methods, I made [this website](https://cobrien-teach.github.io/nycscertweb/).
